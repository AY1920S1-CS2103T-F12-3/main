== About the project: Tagline
Tasked with enhancing the capabilities of a basic command line interface desktop addressbook application, my team chose to extend the functionality to include note-taking capabilities. Combining the existing contact infrastructure with tags and note support, we aim to make a more people-centric note taking platform we call Tagline. This application aims to help students more easily organize and find their notes based on the people the notes are connected to.
This is what our project looks like

My role for this project is to implement the `Group`  feature to allow for organizing `Contact`s together into `Groups` which can be used to manage notes as a whole. The following sections together with documentation added to the user and developer guides depict this enhancement in greater detail.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I added a range of features providing the *ability to group contacts together* for better organization
** What it does: with `group create` a group of contacts can be created, contacts can be added or removed using `group add` and `group remove` commands. Groups can be searched for and displayed using `group list` and `group find`.
** Justification: social circles exist in more than just a one to one relationship and can belong in a group with a shared feature be it an orientation group of friends who all know each other or a project group with common purpose. Having the capability to quickly reference other contacts in the same group would make the user experience much better compared to scrolling through an alphabetically ordered list in an addressbook.
** Highlights: this enhancements supplements the existing structure of the addressbook.

* *Code contributed*: The following links highlight samples of my code [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/tagline/logic/parser/group/GroupCommandParser.java[Functional code]] [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-3/main/blob/master/src/test/java/tagline/model/group/GroupManagerTest.java[Test code]] _

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

==== Add member to a group: `add`
Adds members to a group.

Format:

`group add GROUP_NAME [--i CONTACT_ID]+`

Example:

* `group add CS2103-F12-3 --i 12345 --i 23451 --i 34512 --i 45123 --i 51234`
+
Adds contacts with ID '_12345_', '_23451_', '_34512_', '_45123_', and '_51234_' to the group with name '_CS2103-F12-3_' as group members.



Illustrated Example:

We wish to add contact with ID '_90040_' to the group '_ao3_' +
First use the command
* `group add ao3 --i 90040`

.Entering the command

Then, +
The contact with ID '_90040_' would then be added the group '_ao3_'

.Contact with matching contact id gets added into the group

=== [Proposed] Group Contacts feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The grouping feature is facilitated by `GroupBook` an additional Model component in addition to the current `AddressBook`.
It extends the functionality of `AddressBook` by providing a way to group contacts together into unique `Group` classes
identified by their `GroupName`. This allows users to form more natural associations of
contacts such as "BTS-members". Identifying which contacts are group members of a `Group` is done by
storing a record of their `ContactId` in the `Group`.
Additionally, `GroupManager` extends Tagline with the following operations:

* `GroupManager#getGroupBook()` -- Retrieves a view only version of the groups for storing data after app quits.
* `GroupManager#deleteGroup()` -- Deletes a group from the list of groups currently available.
* `GroupManager#addGroup()` -- Adds a group to the list of groups currently available.
* `GroupManager#setGroup()` -- Replaces a group in the list of groups with another group.
* `GroupManager#getFilteredGroupList()` -- Returns a view only list of groups containing a subset of available Groups.
* `GroupManager#updateFilteredGroupList()` -- Specifies which groups will be retrieved by `GroupManager#getFilteredGroupList()`.

The above operations are exposed in the `Model` interface by their respective method names.

* `GroupCommand#findOneGroup()` -- Retrieves one Group with name matching the exact provided String.
* `GroupCommand#verifyMemberIdWithModel()` -- Compares members currently in a group with contacts in `AddressBook` and returns only those found in `AddressBook`.
* `GroupCommand#setDifference()` -- Used to get contactids specified which do not exist in `AddressBook`.

These above are static utility functions which form the underlying structure of how a `GroupCommand` works.

Given below is an example usage scenario on how a typical lifecycle of a `Group` behaves at each step.
With emphasis on showing the effects of `DeleteCommand` as an example of a command from `ContactCommand`
would interact with `GroupCommand` and `GroupModel` state.


Step 1. The user initially has several contacts in `AddressBook`. +

.Simplified state of relevant Model components initially
image::GroupContactsState0.png[]


The `AddressBook` model state contains all the `Contact` class that exists in the App.
 Since no `Group` has been created yet, `GroupBook` model state is currently empty.
 All of the contacts found in `AddressBook` are displayed on the `UI` by default.


Step 2. Wishing to better organize her contacts into groups, the user executes `group create BTS` calling
 `CreateGroupCommand`. to create a new `Group` instance with no members. +

.State after Group "BTS" is created
image::GroupContactsState1.png[]

The `GroupBook` model state now contains a `Group` instance for "BTS" with no members
 recorded as memberIds.
Any command regarding `Group` would prompt the `UI` to display the contacts in the group.
 A group with no members would cause the `UI` to be empty. As there are no contacts in the group.
 While a group with members in it would cause `UI` to display all the contacts belonging
 to that group.


Step 3. The user then executes `group add BTS --i 00001 --i 00002 --i 0013 --i 0004`
 calling the `addMembersToGroupCommand` to add several contacts to the group. Only the String
 representation of the `ContactId` will be stored in the `Group`. +

.State after four contacts are added into Group "BTS"
image::GroupContactsState2.png[]

`Group` "BTS" now has members in it and the `UI` would display all the contacts found in the
 group.


Step 4. The user realizes she has made a mistake adding a wrong contact and in a fit of rage
 chooses to delete the contact instead of merely removing the contact from the Group.
 Executing `contact delete --i 00013`
 which then deletes the `Contact` with contactId of 00013.
 However, this does not remove the contact's id from
 the memberId attribute in the `Group` the contact was in. This step does not involve `GroupModel` in any way. +

.State after contact with contactId = 00013 is deleted
image::GroupContactsState3.png[]

Deleting a `Contact` would cause it to be removed from `AddressBook` model state and the `Contact`
 no longer exists. While the `UI` display no longer shows contact of 00013, it is still recorded as a member in
 `GroupBook` model state. The updating of `GroupBook` model state is deferred.


Step 5. The user then executes `group add BTS --i 00003` to add the correct contact as a member on the `Group`
 and view the `Contact` profiles.
 This calls `AddMemberToGroupCommand` which then updates the `Group` ensuring that all memberIds correspond to an existing
 `ContactId` found in `AddressBook`. The contacts of the group are also displayed to the user.  +

.State after user views contacts of Group "BTS"
image::GroupContactsState4.png[]

Here, the `GroupBook` model state is updated and memberId of 00013 from the previous step is removed while `Contact`
 with contactId of 00003 is added into the `Group`. This change is also reflected in the `UI`.
Now all is as it should be in `Group` "BTS". +


The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `FindGroupCommand` which
 which updates the `Group` similar to how `AddMemberToGroupCommand` does in the above example:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How groups stores contacts

* **Alternative 1:** Stores `ContactId` class in a `Collection` in `Group`
** Pros: Easy to get `ContactId` from `Group` to retrieve `Contact` classes from `Addressbook`.
** Cons: Increases coupling to implementation of `Contact`. Storage and retrieval after reloading the app would also
 cause new instances of `ContactId` to be created when loading `Group` or would require more complicated
 loading of `Group` from storage having to happen after `AddressBook` is loaded and having to reference
 `Contact` classes to ensure the same `ContactId` class is referenced by both `Contact` and `Group` it is in.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Stores `Collection` of Strings which are able to uniquely identify `Contact`.
** Pros: Group classes are less coupled to implementation of `Contact`. Simpler to load `Group` classes from storage.
 due to not needing to check and obtain a reference to `ContactId`. User input is also parsed as Strings.
** Cons: Deciding when to check if members are still part of a `Group` since it need not be done at loading time.
 While it is more flexible, can be a potential source of confusion as it may be possible to forget to update
 the members in `Group`.
