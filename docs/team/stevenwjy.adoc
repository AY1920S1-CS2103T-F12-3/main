== PROJECT: TagLine

== About the project

My team of 5 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project.

We chose to morph it into a note management application called Tagline. This enhanced application enables students to take notes easily and associate them with contacts.

Below is a screenshot of our project:

My main role was to create a contact profile feature to display notes that are associated with a contact along with other information that are stored about the contact (e.g. email and phone number).

The following sections illustrate some more specific enhancements I have made to the UI, as well as some relevant documentation in the user and developer guides related to these enhancements.
